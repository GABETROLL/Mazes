# Mazes
An old pygame script to generate different types of mazes. I only got to making a "binary tree" maze, if I remember correctly.
## Installation
First, make sure that you have Python 3 installed.

Clone this repository:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:GABETROLL/Mazes.git
$ cd Mazes/
```
Install Pygame:
```
$ pip3 install pygame
```
For windows, run: ``pip install pygame``
## Usage
Running the program:
```
$ python3 main.py
```
Press the spacebar to start building the maze.
